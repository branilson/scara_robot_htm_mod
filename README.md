# Scara robot HTM modified version

This project is based on the original design from Dejan Nedelkovski of the portal www.howtomechatronics.com.



## List of modifications:

- Conversion of CAD files to FreeCAD
- Replacement of the Z-axis smooth rods and linear bearings to 8 mm
- Modification of the Z-axis covers
- Modification of the Z-axis end-stop switch support
- Modification of the smooth rod clamp design to allow the motor to go inside the top cover
- Reduction of the final height
- Replacement of some printed plates with PC machined parts in order to make construction faster
- small modifications in the printed parts in order to avoid print supports, reduce post-processing, and facilitate the assembling process
- Added all nuts and bolts in the assembly

## ToDo:

- Reduce the size of the base part
- Make a FreeCAD final assembly
- Create an electrical documentation
- Embed a cement/clay extruder to transform it on a 3D printer
- Add magnetic encoders to the stepper motors
- Code an automatic learn functionality based on the closed loop motor controls
- Port code to STM32
- Develop a simulation in Gazebo/Ignition
- Develop a ROS2 controller node

## Final considerations

Thanks to Dejan Nedelkovski for the amazing work.

Suggestions and collaboration do enhance this version and developing the pending features are welcome.
